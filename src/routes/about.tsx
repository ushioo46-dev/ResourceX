            Hotels, banquet halls, caterers and event companies own far more inventory than they use on
            any given day. Meanwhile, a business two kilometres away is calling brokers to find 150
            chairs for tomorrow evening. ResourceX closes that gap.

            Providers publish resources with quantity, pricing and availability. Seekers describe a
            requirement in plain language. The Smart Matching Engine — a transparent weighted scoring
            algorithm — ranks the options, Google Maps shows what is genuinely nearby, and every
            request, negotiation, booking and fulfilment step is tracked in one place.

            Marketplace for Shared Resources”, using realistic demo data across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai,
            Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Delhi.
